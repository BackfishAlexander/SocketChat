## Socket Chat Client/Server
This code was one of many projects that I have completed as part of my Java coursework. It uses Sockets to make a client/server to handle a scalable chat system (similar to IRC chatrooms)
Some ideas demonstrated in this code are:

 - `Threading`
 - `Network communication`
 - `Dealing with race conditions`
 - `Finding a balance between server performance and security (never trust the client)`
