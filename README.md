## Socket Chat Client/Server
This code was one of many projects that I completed for a Java courses. It uses Sockets to make a client as well as a server to handle many client socket connections for a chat server.
Some ideas demonstrated in this code are:

 - `Threading`
 - `Network communication`
 - `Dealing with race conditions`
 - `Finding a balance between server performance and security (never trust the client)`
